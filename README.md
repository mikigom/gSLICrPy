### Requirements
```
  - python3 (>= .5)
  - cmake (>= 2.8.10.2)
  - CUDA (>= 6.0)  
  - OpenCV (>= 3.0)
```
### Build Process
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
python3 example.py
```

### A note for Windows users
When building, instead of running `make`, run `cmake --build . --config Release`.
Before running the python script example.py, you need to change the line where the funciton `__get_CUDA_gSLICr__` is
called to `__CUDA_gSLICr__ = __get_CUDA_gSLICr__("./build/Release/DEMO.dll")`. 


### Example

When n_iters=50, above example (2880 x 1800) is processed in 220ms on 1080Ti.
